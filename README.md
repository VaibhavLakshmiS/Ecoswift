# EcoSwift: A Sustainable Commute Initiative

## Introduction

EcoSwift was conceptualized and designed during a 48-hour weekend at the Evolve Hackathon hosted by the University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC). Our team, comprising five dedicated members, collaborated intensely to turn a bold idea into a tangible solution. This intense period of innovation not only led to the creation of EcoSwift but also earned us a spot in the top 10 out of 50 teams.

## About the Hackathon Experience
The Evolve Hackathon provided us with a platform to challenge conventional thinking and address urgent environmental issues through technology. Over the course of the weekend, we engaged in rapid prototyping, iterative design, and collaborative problem-solving, which culminated in the development of our Figma prototype for EcoSwift.
The constraints of time and resources during the event led to a focus on innovation, adaptability, and user-centered design, which are now the core tenets of the EcoSwift platform.




## Figma Prototype

Our Figma prototype is a visual testament to EcoSwift's user-centered design approach. It embodies our commitment to accessibility, functionality, and sustainability. Hereâ€™s how our design supports EcoSwift's goals:

### User Experience (UX)
The intuitive UX design ensures that users from all demographics can easily navigate through the app, facilitating a seamless transition to eco-friendly commuting.

### User Interface (UI)
Our UI is crafted to be visually appealing yet straightforward, encouraging user engagement while promoting the core values of community and sustainability.
